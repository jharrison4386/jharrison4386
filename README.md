Howdy!

My name is Jacob Harrison and I am an undergraduate student at Texas A&M University at College Station studying Meteorology with a minor in statistics.
I am hoping to pursue further education at Texas A&M with a masters in statistics. My career goals are to become a data analyst with focuses on Machine Learning (ML) applications.

I am currently working on making a neural network in python from scratch without using any major packages that make the network itself for me. I am hoping to have an end result
that recognizes numbers on a paper and can perform simple math equations using said numbers.

This page page will be a place where I put all of my fun little projects that I do to entertain myself or make my life a little bit easier. Projects that I consider more
professional or important will be marked to indicate so.
